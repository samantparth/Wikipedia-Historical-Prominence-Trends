ChatGPT:
The error you're seeing suggests that `read_csv()` is trying to read the file as a plain CSV, but the file is actually compressed in some format (likely `.gz`), which causes R to misinterpret the file contents. The file might be a `.gz` archive that needs to be decompressed before reading.

Here’s how to resolve the issue:

### Step 1: Download the File as a Compressed `.gz` File

If you’re working with a compressed file (e.g., `.gz`), you need to download it as-is and then read it with appropriate decompression handling. Here’s how to do it:

#### Option 1: Use `httr` to Download and Handle Compression

```r
library(httr)
library(readr)

# URL for the file
url <- "https://data.sciencespo.fr/api/access/datafile/4432?gbrecs=true"
destfile <- "data/raw_data.csv.gz"  # Save as a .gz file

# Download the file with a timeout (adjust the timeout if necessary)
response <- GET(url, write_disk(destfile, overwrite = TRUE), timeout(300))

# Check if download was successful
if (status_code(response) == 200) {
  message("Download successful!")
} else {
  message("Download failed with status: ", status_code(response))
}

# Read the .gz CSV file
data <- read_csv(gzfile(destfile))

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

#### Option 2: Use `curl` (alternative download method)
```r
library(curl)
library(readr)

# URL for the file
url <- "https://data.sciencespo.fr/api/access/datafile/4432?gbrecs=true"
destfile <- "data/raw_data.csv.gz"  # Save as a .gz file

# Use curl to download the file
curl_download(url, destfile, handle = curl::new_handle(timeout = 300))

# Read the .gz CSV file
data <- read_csv(gzfile(destfile))

# View the first few rows
head(data)
```

### Step 2: Ensure Correct File Reading
If the file is not in `.csv` format and might be a different type of file inside the `.gz` archive (such as a `.txt` file), you might need to adjust how you read it. For example, if it’s tab-delimited:

```r
data <- read_delim(gzfile(destfile), delim = "\t")  # For tab-delimited files
```

### Step 3: Inspect the File

If you’re unsure about the contents of the file, you can first unzip it manually and inspect the content:

```r
# Extract the file first (if needed)
gunzip("data/raw_data.csv.gz", remove = FALSE)

# Check the file contents
file.info("data/raw_data.csv")
```
