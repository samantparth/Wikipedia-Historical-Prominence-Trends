L. Jacoby, C. M. Kelley, J. Brown, and J. Jasechko (1989). In Experiments 1-4, participants pronounced 72 names of famous and nonfamous men and women, and 24 or 48 hr later made fame judgments in response to the 72 familiar and 72 unfamiliar famous and nonfamous names. These first experiments, in which signal detection analysis was used to assess implicit stereotypes, demonstrate that the gender bias (greater assignment of fame to male than female names) was located in the use of a lower criterion (beta) for judging fame of familiar male than female names. Experiments 3 and 4 also showed that explicit expressions of sexism or stereotypes were uncorrelated with the observed implicit gender bias in fame judgments.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Personality and Social Psychology}, author={Banaji, M.

 @article{workplace_sexism, title={Gender inequalities in the workplace: the effects of organizational structures, processes, practices, and decision makers’ sexism}, volume={6}, ISSN={1664-1078}, DOI={10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01400}, abstractNote={Gender inequality in organizations is a complex phenomenon that can be seen in organizational structures, processes, and practices. For women, some of the most harmful gender inequalities are enacted within human resources (HRs) practices. This is because HR practices (i.e., policies, decision-making, and their enactment) affect the hiring, training, pay, and promotion of women. We propose a model of gender discrimination in HR that emphasizes the reciprocal nature of gender inequalities within organizations. We suggest that gender discrimination in HR-related decision-making and in the enactment of HR practices stems from gender inequalities in broader organizational structures, processes, and practices. This includes leadership, structure, strategy, culture, organizational climate, as well as HR policies. In addition, organizational decision makers’ levels of sexism can affect their likelihood of making gender biased HR-related decisions and/or behaving in a sexist manner while enacting HR practices. Importantly, institutional discrimination in organizational structures, processes, and practices play a pre-eminent role because not only do they affect HR practices, they also provide a socializing context for organizational decision makers’ levels of hostile and benevolent sexism. Although we portray gender inequality as a self-reinforcing system that can perpetuate discrimination, important levers for reducing discrimination are identified.}, journal={Frontiers in Psychology}, author={Stamarski, Cailin S. and Son Hing, Leanne S.}, year={2015}, month=sep, pages={1400} }

Examples of these integer-valued parameters of the model include the orders of an autoregressive moving average model, the number of sinusoidal components in a sinusoids-in-noise signal, and the number of source signals impinging on a sensor array. In each of these cases, the integer-valued parameters determine the dimension of the parameter vector of the data model, and they must be estimated from the data.}, number={4}, journal={IEEE Signal Processing Magazine}, author={Stoica, P. and Selen, Y.}, year={2004}, month=jul, pages={36–47} }
